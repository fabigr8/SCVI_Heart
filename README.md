# ❤️🔬 SCVI_Heart 

or single cell variational inference of the Human Heart.
here I reproduce a single-cell variational model and analysis of the Nature paper of Litviňuková et al. (2020).

## 📄 Paper: 

Litviňuková, M., Talavera-López, C., Maatz, H., Reichart, D.,Worth, C. L., Lindberg, E. L., … & Teichmann, S. A. (2020). Cells of the adult human heart. Nature, 588(7838), 466-472.

## 📊 Data:

single cells, nuclei and CD45+ enriched cells from the left and right ventricular free walls, left and right atrium, the left ventricular apex, and interventricular septum, from 14 adults.
After processing with 10X Genomics and a generative deep variational autoencoder, the resulting dataset comprises 45,870 cells, 78,023 CD45+ enriched cells and 363,213 nuclei for 11 major cell types:"
  * atrial cardiomyocytes,
  * ventricular cardiomyocytes,
  * fibroblasts (FBs),
  * endothelial cells (ECs),
  * pericytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs),
  * immune cells (myeloid and lymphoid),
  * adipocytes,
  * mesothelial cells
  * and neuronal cells

## 🎯 Goal:

mapping out the genomics data as represemted by Litviňuková et al. (2020) in Nature.
